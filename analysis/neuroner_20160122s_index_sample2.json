Manufacturers and regulatory agencies are developing scientifically based guidelines for such products. It is currently possible to follow these guidelines to prepare recombinant biologicals and monoclonal antibodies in CCLs which do not pose unreasonable risks. This chapter has attempted to describe the scientific tools available to evaluate the putative risk of tumorigenicity due to potential virus DNA and protein contaminants. No theoretical or experimental basis exists to hypothesize that residual cellular protein might present a significant risk of tumorigenicity. The tools are certainly adequate for characterization of putative risks due to viruses and DNA but are not sufficiently powerful by themselves to assure product safety. The subsequent chapter on process validation describes how adequate assurances of safety ultimately can be obtained for products of CCLs against theoretical risks of tumorigenicity due to putative viruses and DNA. In addition to these safeguards, no evidence of tumorigenicity has been found in human or livestock animal recipients of the products prepared in CCL substrates. Many patients have received inoculations of tissue plasminogen activator, erythropoeitin, factor VIII, soluble CD4, GM-CSF, hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine, and various monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant products of continuous cell lines in clinical trials. For tissue plasminogen activator, large doses of 100 mg per patient or more have been used. At the time of writing over 10 kg of CHO-derived tissue plasminogen activator has been sold since late 1987 for administration to over 100,000 human patients. For recombinant factor VIII, erythropoeitin, and soluble CD4 proteins, chronic administration has been employed. Millions have received polio and rabies vaccines prepared in continuous Vero cells. In addition to this human experience, livestock animals have received annual inoculations of foot-and-mouth virus vaccine prepared in BHK-21 (a highly tumorigenic CCL) for up to 14 years without effect (69). No effects have been reported which might be attributed to oncogenic factors. Thus, scientific tools of characterization and principles of process validation are available to protect patients from putative risks of tumorigenicity associated with products prepared in CCLs. Increasing clinical experience also supports this conclusion.","authors":["A S Lubiniecki"],"published_date":"1991-06-12","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"continuous cell","start":1544,"end":1559,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":1555,"end":1559},{"neuron_type":"electrophysiology","property_text":"continuous","start":1544,"end":1554}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"developing","neuron_type":"developmental","start":236,"end":246,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:0000009"},{"property_text":"putative","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":543,"end":551,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7261"},{"property_text":"putative","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":827,"end":835,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7261"},{"property_text":"putative","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1127,"end":1135,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7261"},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":1234,"end":1239,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"continuous","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1544,"end":1554},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":1620,"end":1625},{"property_text":"late","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1776,"end":1780},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":1821,"end":1826,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"continuous","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":2011,"end":2021},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":2054,"end":2059,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"putative","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":2439,"end":2447,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7261"}]},"fields":{"authors":["A S Lubiniecki"]}}

The in vivo and in vitro phenotypic transformations of smooth muscle cells have been confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, but the relationship between this change and the cell cycle is still unknown. We demonstrated the structural modulation of rabbit arterial smooth muscle cells in primary culture by transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry and simultaneously studied changes in two-dimensional histograms of the relative DNA and RNA contents by flow cytometry. During the first day of primary culture, the cells exhibited the contractile phenotype and were composed of a population in the G0 phase characterized by low contents of DNA and RNA. On the second day of culture, some of the cells (18.2%) had started but not completed the transition into the synthetic phenotype and a cell population in the G1A phase with an RNA content above the G0 level appeared in almost the same proportion. This cell population could be categorized as an \"intermediate\" type. Moreover, after 3 days when about three-quarters of the cells had undergone structural transition, the same proportion of cells had entered into the cycling phase, while some cells still remained in the G0 and G1A phases. Thus, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry corresponded well with the observations obtained by transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. These results show that flow cytometry can rapidly and relatively conveniently monitor the process of phenotypic modulation in smooth muscle cells and is a useful method for the analysis of such transitions.","authors":["M Yamamoto","K Fujita","T Shinkai","K Yamamoto","T Noumura"],"published_date":"1992-01-06","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"cells in primary","start":385,"end":401,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":385,"end":390},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"primary","start":394,"end":401}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"rabbit","neuron_type":"species","start":355,"end":361,"onto_id":"ncbi:9986"},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":394,"end":401},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":615,"end":622},{"property_text":"rapidly","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1510,"end":1517}]},"fields":{"authors":["M Yamamoto","K Fujita","T Shinkai","K Yamamoto","T Noumura"]}}

The N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced formation of [3H]citrulline reached a plateau within 10 min. Subsequent addition of unlabeled L-arginine resulted in the disappearance of 3H from the citrulline pool, indicating a persistent activation of nitric oxide synthase after N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor stimulation. Glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and kainate, but not quisqualate, stimulated both the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline and cyclic GMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate showed similar potencies for the stimulation of [3H]citrulline formation and cyclic GMP synthesis, respectively, whereas kainate was more potent at inducing cyclic GMP accumulation than at stimulating [3H]citrulline formation. Both the [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline conversion and cyclic GMP synthesis stimulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate were inhibited by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 and by the inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and NG-nitro-L-arginine. However, monomethyl-L-arginine, in contrast to nitro-L-arginine, also potently inhibited [3H]arginine uptake. Kainate (300 microM) stimulated 45Ca2+ influx to the same extent as 100 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate, but stimulated [3H]citrulline formation to a much lesser extent, which suggests that nitric oxide synthase is localized in subcellular compartments where the Ca2+ concentration is regulated mainly by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.","authors":["L Kiedrowski","E Costa","J T Wroblewski"],"published_date":"1992-01-22","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"cerebellar granule cells","start":171,"end":195,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":190,"end":195},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"cerebellar","start":171,"end":181,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:512"},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"granule","start":182,"end":189,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000026"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"glutamate","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":4,"end":13,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000004"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":14,"end":22},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":42,"end":51,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"rapid","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":65,"end":70},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":151,"end":158},{"property_text":"cerebellar","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":171,"end":181,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:512"},{"property_text":"granule","neuron_type":"morphology","start":182,"end":189,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000026"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":208,"end":216},{"property_text":"nitric oxide synthase","neuron_type":"protein","start":240,"end":261,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:18126"},{"property_text":"aspartate-","neuron_type":"protein","start":278,"end":288,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"nitric oxide synthase","neuron_type":"protein","start":501,"end":522,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:18126"},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":540,"end":549,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":550,"end":558},{"property_text":"Glutamate","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":572,"end":581,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000004"},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":594,"end":603,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"Glutamate","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":760,"end":769,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000004"},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":785,"end":794,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":1123,"end":1132,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":1166,"end":1175,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1176,"end":1184},{"property_text":"nitric oxide synthase","neuron_type":"protein","start":1228,"end":1249,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:18126"},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":1501,"end":1510,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"nitric oxide synthase","neuron_type":"protein","start":1597,"end":1618,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:18126"},{"property_text":"aspartate","neuron_type":"protein","start":1727,"end":1736,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14810"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1737,"end":1745}]},"fields":{"authors":["L Kiedrowski","E Costa","J T Wroblewski"]}}

In the primate host, poliovirus infection is characterized by restricted tissue tropism. To determine the pattern of poliovirus tissue tropism in poliovirus receptor transgenic mice, poliovirus receptor gene expression and susceptibility to poliovirus infection were examined by in situ hybridization. poliovirus receptor RNA is expressed in transgenic mice at high levels in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system, developing T lymphocytes in the thymus, epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule and tubules in the kidney, alveolar cells in the lung, and endocrine cells in the adrenal cortex, and it is expressed at low levels in intestine, spleen, and skeletal muscle. After infection, poliovirus replication was detected only in neurons of the brain and spinal cord and in skeletal muscle. These results demonstrated that poliovirus tissue tropism is not governed solely by expression of the poliovirus receptor gene nor by accessibility of cells to virus. Although transgenic mouse kidney tissue expressed poliovirus binding sites and was not a site of poliovirus replication, when cultivated in vitro, kidney cells developed susceptibility to infection.

Moreover, heat shock protein 70 expression was synergistically increased in HeLa cells cotransfected with US3 and UL36, with US3 and UL37, or with US3 and UL37x1.

Synergistic transactivation of heat shock protein 70 expression in HeLa cells required the syntheses of UL36-38 and US3 immediate-early proteins, since nonsense mutants were not functional. heat shock protein 70 expression increased with increasing amounts of transfected US3 and UL37 DNA and occurred at the level of stable heat shock protein 70-promoted RNA. In contrast to the broad heat shock protein 70 response, promoters from the human cytomegalovirus UL112 early gene and another cellular gene, brain creatine kinase, both responded strongly only to singly transfected immediate-early2 in HeLa cells. Nevertheless, immediate-early2 transactivation of the UL112 promoter was further stimulated by cotransfection of immediate-early1 or of UL36-38 in both HeLa and HFF cells. Thus, different patterns of promoter transactivation and interactions between human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene products in transactivation were found in HFF cells and in HeLa cells.

The continuous growth of these cells was found to be dependent on the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol. Removal of this thiol compound caused a 15-fold drop in total cellular glutathione levels. These cells proliferated slowly (population doubling time about 100 h) and, in general, showed morphological characteristics typical of native beta-cells. Most cells stained positive for insulin and did not react with antibodies against the other islet hormones. The content of immunoreactive insulin was about 8 micrograms/10(6) cells, corresponding to 20% of the native beta-cell content. These cells synthesized both proinsulin I and II and displayed conversion rates of the two precursor hormones similar to those observed in rat islets. However, glucose failed to stimulate the rate of proinsulin biosynthesis. In static incubations, glucose stimulated insulin secretion from floating cell clusters or from attached cells. Under perifusion conditions, 10 mM but not 1 mM glucose enhanced secretion 2.2-fold. In the presence of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, increase of glucose concentration from 2.8-20 mM caused a 4-fold enhancement of the rate of secretion. Glucose also depolarized INS-1 cells and raised the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+. This suggests that glucose is still capable of eliciting part of the ionic events at the plasma membrane, which leads to insulin secretion. The structural and functional characteristics of INS-1 cells remained unchanged over a period of 2 yr (about 80 passages). Although INS-2 cells have not been fully characterized, their insulin content was similar to that of INS-1 cells and they also remain partially sensitive to glucose as a secretagogue. INS-1 cells retain beta-cell surface antigens, as revealed by reactivity with the antigangloside monoclonal antibodies R2D6 and A2B5. These findings indicate that INS-1 cells have remained stable and retain a high degree of differentiation which should make them a suitable model for studying various aspects of beta-cell function.","authors":["M Asfari","D Janjic","P Meda","G Li","P A Halban","C B Wollheim"],"published_date":"1992-01-27","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"insulin-secreting cell","start":4,"end":26,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":22,"end":26},{"neuron_type":"protein","property_text":"insulin-secreting","start":4,"end":21,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16333"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"insulin-secreting","neuron_type":"protein","start":4,"end":21,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16333"},{"property_text":"rat","neuron_type":"species","start":110,"end":113,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"continuous","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":145,"end":155},{"property_text":"slowly","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":361,"end":367},{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":510,"end":518},{"property_text":"insulin","neuron_type":"protein","start":523,"end":530,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16333"},{"property_text":"immunoreactive insulin","neuron_type":"protein","start":614,"end":636,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16333"},{"property_text":"proinsulin","neuron_type":"protein","start":756,"end":766,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16334"},{"property_text":"precursor","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":818,"end":827,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7293"},{"property_text":"rat","neuron_type":"species","start":866,"end":869,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"proinsulin","neuron_type":"protein","start":927,"end":937,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16334"},{"property_text":"insulin","neuron_type":"protein","start":994,"end":1001,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16333"},{"property_text":"depolarized","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1327,"end":1338},{"property_text":"insulin","neuron_type":"protein","start":1520,"end":1527,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16333"},{"property_text":"functional","neuron_type":"function","start":1558,"end":1568},{"property_text":"insulin","neuron_type":"protein","start":1724,"end":1731,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16333"}]},"fields":{"authors":["M Asfari","D Janjic","P Meda","G Li","P A Halban","C B Wollheim"]}}

The distinctive cells were characterized by bright, eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules on routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained material. The cytoplasmic granules in the benign prostatic epithelium were periodate-Schiff's procedure-positive and diastase resistant and immunohistochemically negative for lysozyme, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, and serotonin. The eosinophilic granules in the prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma cases were immunohistochemically positive for chromogranin, serotonin, and neuron-specific enolase, and negative for lysozyme. By electron microscopy the eosinophilic granules represented exocrine-like or lysosomal-like vesicles in the benign epithelium and neuro-endocrine granules in the malignant epithelium. The lesion represents a prostatic epithelial Paneth cell-like change rather than a Paneth cell metaplasia. Paneth cell-like change is the common histological manifestation of two different phenomena: (a) a periodate-Schiff's procedure-positive and diastase-resistant eosinophilic cytoplasmic granular change in benign prostatic epithelium, and (b) endocrine differentiation with neuroendocrine granules in dysplastic and malignant prostatic epithelia. The importance of recognizing Paneth cell-like change lies in its differentiation from other possible prostatic cytoplasmic inclusions.","authors":["M G Weaver","F W Abdul-Karim","J Srigley","D G Bostwick","J Y Ro","A G Ayala"],"published_date":"1992-01-29","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"neuron","start":580,"end":586,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neuron","start":580,"end":586}]},{"neuron_text":"neuron","start":797,"end":803,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neuron","start":797,"end":803}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":499,"end":507},{"property_text":"enolase","neuron_type":"protein","start":596,"end":603,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:13806"},{"property_text":"serotonin","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":623,"end":632,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000001"},{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":755,"end":763},{"property_text":"serotonin","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":782,"end":791,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000001"},{"property_text":"enolase","neuron_type":"protein","start":813,"end":820,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:13806"},{"property_text":"epithelial","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1068,"end":1078,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:52"},{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":1269,"end":1277},{"property_text":"granular","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1326,"end":1334,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7294"},{"property_text":"neuroendocrine","neuron_type":"function","start":1413,"end":1427},{"property_text":"dysplastic","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1440,"end":1450,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:108"}]},"fields":{"authors":["M G Weaver","F W Abdul-Karim","J Srigley","D G Bostwick","J Y Ro","A G Ayala"]}}

To determine whether human lymphokine activated killer cells mediate veto and natural suppression we measured their ability to inhibit generation of allospecific cytotoxic T cells in mixed lymphocyte culture. When added to MLCs at low concentrations lymphokine activated killer cells caused veto-type inhibition: stimulator-type lymphokine activated killer cells inhibited generation of cytotoxic T cells but responder or third-party lymphokine activated killer cells did not. At higher concentrations lymphokine activated killer cells caused nonspecific inhibition: all three lymphokine activated killer cell types inhibited generation of cytotoxic T cells. lymphokine activated killer cell veto and natural suppressor activities were largely eliminated by irradiation with 30 Gy and by depletion of CD56+ cells, but increased after depletion of CD3+ cells. lymphokine activated killer cell veto activity is not likely an artifact of cold-target inhibition by the lymphokine activated killer cells themselves or by proliferation of T cells contaminating lymphokine activated killer cell preparations: (1) veto only occurred when lymphokine activated killer cells were added to mixed lymphocyte culture on days 0 through 2, but not when added on day 5; (2) addition of saturating numbers of labeled targets to fixed numbers of allo-cytotoxic T cells effectors failed to overcome the inhibitory effects of adding stimulator-type lymphokine activated killer cells at the onset of mixed lymphocyte culture; and (3) CD3-depleted lymphokine activated killer cells showed greater veto activity than threefold greater numbers of control lymphokine activated killer cells.

Upon oral administration of four 20-mg capsules of omeprazole twice daily, rapid healing of the diffuse mucosal ulcerations of the upper GI tract as well as control of diarrhea were achieved. Clinical benefit accompagnied dramatic and sustained reductions in gastric acid secretion as demonstrated by repeated basal output measurements and 24-hour intragastric pH recording. The biodisponibility of omeprazole improved as gastric intraluminal acidity was reduced. The effects of omeprazole on pepsin output appeared to be mainly related to the reduction of gastric secretory volume. After more than one year of treatment, neither clinical nor biological side-effects were noted. However, repeated ultrastructural studies of fundic gastric mucosa revealed two types of alterations: a) a pattern of hyper-stimulated parietal cells with turgescent intra-cellular micro-canalicus invested by numerous microvilli; b) in about a fourth of the parietal cells, cytoplasmic modifications resembling auto-phagosomia and mitochondrial reduction in number and morphological transformation.

Various methods have been used in attempts to observe more details of the endings of nerve fibers on the sensory hair cells. In this study, a new method of microdissection of Corti's organ was done using a small piece of double-sided adhesive tape. This method is simple and facilitates observation of Corti's organ from the basal to the apical turns. Using it we found variations of the nerve endings and the Deiters' cells in each half turn beginning from the lower basal turn to the upper fourth turn. Nerve endings at the lower poles of outer hair cells are arranged in clusters, and are reduced in size and number as the upper turn is approached. On the contrary, the Deiters' cells are increased in size toward the upper turn, therefore nerve endings in the upper turn are often covered by Deiters' cells.

The intracellular elemental concentrations of potassium, sodium and iron were determined: 1) in the reticulocytes of peripheral blood from dogs with experimentally and naturally accelerated erythropoiesis, using wavelength-dispersive spectrometry of intact single cells; and 2) in the various erythropoietic cells of normal, adult dog marrow, using energy-dispersive spectroscopy of quench-frozen cryosections. The former experiments demonstrated that the switch from high potassium to low potassium cell type, which occurs during or slightly before denucleation of the orthochromatophilic erythroblast, is clearly correlated with a decrease in potassium concentration and also with the bulk of hemoglobin synthesis. The studies using cryosectioned preparations of normal dog confirmed a similar, negative correlation between sodium and potassium, although in this case only the onset of iron accumulation could be detected in the nucleated cells. When combined with the morphological information available from cryosections, it is concluded that the most immature erythroid cells are high potassium cells (CK greater than 80 mmols/kg wet-wt.), whereas a majority of the later erythroid cells were of the low potassium variety (CK less than 10 mmols/kg). This indicates that in normal dogs, the switch from high potassium to low potassium type occurs mainly in the basophilic erythroblasts.","authors":["R G Kirk","S B Andrews","P Lee"],"published_date":"1983-12-20","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"stem cells","start":31,"end":41,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":36,"end":41},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"stem","start":31,"end":35,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"}]},{"neuron_text":"single cells","start":184,"end":196,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":191,"end":196},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"single","start":184,"end":190}]},{"neuron_text":"single cells","start":455,"end":467,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":462,"end":467},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"single","start":455,"end":461}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"stem","neuron_type":"morphology","start":31,"end":35,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"},{"property_text":"dog","neuron_type":"species","start":117,"end":120,"onto_id":"ncbi:9615"},{"property_text":"single","neuron_type":"function","start":184,"end":190},{"property_text":"peripheral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":315,"end":325,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:6"},{"property_text":"dogs","neuron_type":"species","start":337,"end":341,"onto_id":"ncbi:9615"},{"property_text":"single","neuron_type":"function","start":455,"end":461},{"property_text":"adult","neuron_type":"developmental","start":523,"end":528,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:0000007"},{"property_text":"dog","neuron_type":"species","start":529,"end":532,"onto_id":"ncbi:9615"},{"property_text":"dog","neuron_type":"species","start":970,"end":973,"onto_id":"ncbi:9615"},{"property_text":"onset","neuron_type":"function","start":1077,"end":1082},{"property_text":"immature","neuron_type":"developmental","start":1254,"end":1262,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:0000010"},{"property_text":"dogs","neuron_type":"species","start":1483,"end":1487,"onto_id":"ncbi:9615"}]},"fields":{"authors":["R G Kirk","S B Andrews","P Lee"]}}

Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that external potassium has a strong influence on repolarization in the isolated ventricular cells. Action potentials in [K+]o = 3.78 mM exhibit a positive over-shoot (greater than zero potential), but repolarization often arrests at congruent to -35 mV unless driven to more negative potentials by hyperpolarizing current. This phenomenon of two levels of resting potential is not observed at [K+]o = 5.78 mM. At the higher potassium concentration, values for maximum diastolic potential, amplitude, maximum rate of rise of phase 0, and action potential duration all are similar to those of intact ventricular muscle. However, the potential at the peak of the action potential plateau (phase 2) in the isolated myocyte is considerably more negative than that of intact myocardium. In addition, there is a conspicuous notch between phases 1 and 2 of the action potential in the isolated myocyte, whereas the notch is small or absent in intact myocardial action potentials. In summary, our method results in a preparation of stable, ultrastructurally and electrophysiologically intact cells, which should prove useful in studies requiring a large and homogeneous population of myocardial cells.","authors":["K Hewett","M J Legato","P Danilo","R B Robinson"],"published_date":"1983-12-17","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"single cells","start":171,"end":183,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":178,"end":183},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"single","start":171,"end":177}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"single","neuron_type":"function","start":41,"end":47},{"property_text":"cardiac","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":48,"end":55,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7272"},{"property_text":"single","neuron_type":"function","start":171,"end":177},{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":547,"end":555},{"property_text":"small","neuron_type":"size","start":1317,"end":1322},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":1540,"end":1545}]},"fields":{"authors":["K Hewett","M J Legato","P Danilo","R B Robinson"]}}

This cell had an irregular nucleus, small profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum, a considerable population of monoribosomes and a few polyribosomes. The incidence of this cell type decreased significantly from 50% at 12 days gestation to approximately 10% of the hemopoietic cells at 17 days gestation. Type I cells could not be classified into a hemopoietic lineage and may represent undifferentiated hemopoietic stem cells. Three forms of erythropoietic cells, designated types II, III, and IV, were identified. These cells had a diffuse cytoplasmic peroxidase reaction, no peroxidase positive membrane-bound organelles, and were approximately 7 micron in diameter. They corresponded to the more classically defined proerythroblast, polychromatophilic erythroblast, and nucleated normoblast, respectively. Types II and III had moderate cytoplasmic reactions, whereas type III, in addition, had a slight nuclear reaction. Type IV cells had a very dense cytoplasmic reaction but no nuclear reaction. Of the myelopoietic cells detected, one form had a slightly reactive Golgi and a few reactive granules. The other form possessed a clearly positive nuclear envelope, rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and a population of reactive granules. The phagocytic sinusoidal lining cells (Kupffer cells) were peroxidase negative in contrast to similar cells in the rat.

Second, intense exteroceptive stimuli, such as an electric shock applied to the tail or placing animals in a shallow ice-water bath, provoked large and abrupt rises in the signal which decayed rapidly. Third, rats eating after a 24-h fast, drinking after a period of dehydration, or presented with novel olfactory or visual stimuli, exhibited much smaller and more gradual rises in the electrochemical signal which were more long-lasting. In each case, the magnitude of the change in electrochemical signal was generally related to the level of behavioral activation, being most prominent when treatments produced a startle response.

Diffuse lymphomas with cell populations consisting of large cells, or mixtures of large and small cells were the most heterogeneous phenotypically and were most resistant to precise definition of immunologic cell lineage. The new Working Formulation for Clinical Usage likewise exhibited considerable heterogeneity of phenotype even within well defined histomorphologic categories. Two immunologic phenotypic variables that conferred a significant favorable prognosis were the expression of surface membrane immunoglobulin (B derivation) and the simultaneous expression of a membrane mu and delta immunoglobulin heavy chain. The results of this study suggest that cell surface marker phenotypic determinations have well defined and potentially useful correlations with histomorphologic classification schemes, and are useful in predicting biologic behavior and prognosis. It is suggested that a knowledge of both immunologic phenotype and histomorphologic characteristics is necessary in formulating therapeutic decisions.","authors":["R A Rudders","R A DeLellis","E T Ahl","S Bernstein","C B Begg"],"published_date":"1984-01-07","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"large cells","start":410,"end":421,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":416,"end":421},{"neuron_type":"size","property_text":"large","start":410,"end":415}]},{"neuron_text":"large and small cells","start":438,"end":459,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":454,"end":459},{"neuron_type":"size","property_text":"large","start":438,"end":443},{"neuron_type":"size","property_text":"small","start":448,"end":453}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"adults","neuron_type":"developmental","start":142,"end":148,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:0000007"},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":410,"end":415},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":438,"end":443},{"property_text":"small","neuron_type":"size","start":448,"end":453}]},"fields":{"authors":["R A Rudders","R A DeLellis","E T Ahl","S Bernstein","C B Begg"]}}

We demonstrate here the directional motility of mast cells in vitro in response to tumor-derived peptides.

The isolated mast cells migrated under agarose in response to medium conditioned by any of eight tumor cell lines but not to medium conditioned by any of a variety of nontumorigenic cell types. The tumor-derived activity is dialyzable (cutoff, Mr 3500), stable to trypsin treatment and to heating at 56 degrees, but destroyed by heating to 100 degrees or by treatment with Streptomyces griseus protease or carboxypeptidase A. Ultrafiltration suggests a molecular weight of 300 to 1000. Two tripeptides, glycylhistidyllysine and N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, were also found to be potent chemoattractants for mast cells. N-Formylmethionylphenylalanine and valylglycylserylglutamic acid (eosinophil chemotactic Factor A) had significantly less chemoattractant activity over the same range of concentrations. Several peptide analogues of glycylhistidyllysine were tested and found to have no activity. The growth of capillary blood vessels toward a growing tumor is generally preceded by an accumulation of mast cells at the tumor site. Based on the results presented here and previous data from our laboratory on mast cell stimulation of capillary endothelial cell migration, we propose an hypothesis that the chemoattraction of mast cells by tumor-derived peptides may be an important early event in tumor neovascularization.","authors":["T J Poole","B R Zetter"],"published_date":"1984-01-07","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"endothelial cell","start":1508,"end":1524,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":1520,"end":1524},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"endothelial","start":1508,"end":1519,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7292"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"characteristic","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":34,"end":48,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:89"},{"property_text":"Rat","neuron_type":"species","start":192,"end":195,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"medium","neuron_type":"size","start":282,"end":288},{"property_text":"soybean","neuron_type":"species","start":322,"end":329,"onto_id":"ncbi:3847"},{"property_text":"medium","neuron_type":"size","start":416,"end":422},{"property_text":"medium","neuron_type":"size","start":479,"end":485},{"property_text":"trypsin","neuron_type":"protein","start":618,"end":625,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16424"},{"property_text":"carboxypeptidase","neuron_type":"protein","start":760,"end":776,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:19025"},{"property_text":"endothelial","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1508,"end":1519,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7292"}]},"fields":{"authors":["T J Poole","B R Zetter"]}}

Northern blot analysis has now shown that in the MCP6 hybrid, human class I genes, i.e., HLA-A,B,C, continued to be transcribed, and cellular levels of the transcripts were similar to, or only slightly lower than, levels in hybrids with a non-embryonal carcinoma phenotype. However, very low levels of mRNA species recognised by a mouse class I gene (H-2) probe were also detected in embryonal carcinoma cells and embryonal carcinoma hybrids. Comparison of the relative levels of H-2 and HLA class I gene transcripts in the embryonal carcinoma hybrids and non-embryonal carcinoma hybrids indicated that the introduced HLA-A,B,C genes were not appropriately regulated in the embryonal carcinoma cell but were subject at least in part to cis control. In contrast to the class I genes, no class II gene (i.e. HLA-DR alpha) transcripts were detected in MCP6.

Large liposomes adhere uniformly all over the surface of the sheet, which proved to be nonadhesive either for other cells or for inert particles. Small liposomes adhere mostly along the margins of the sheet. When the cells are partly detached from each other by mild ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid treatment, the newly accessible cell margins become capable of binding small liposomes. The binding of both types of liposomes is trypsin-sensitive; however large liposomes, bound along the edges of the cellular sheet, are removed slower than those adhering to the inner parts of the sheet. Competition experiments show that large and small liposomes bind to the same sites on the surface of the sheet. Liposome-acceptor proteins are suggested to exist on the surface of epithelial cells. We suppose that these proteins are concentrated along the cell margins and are involved in cell-cell contacts.","authors":["L B Margolis","A A Neyfakh"],"published_date":"1984-01-07","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"epithelial cells","start":1175,"end":1191,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":1186,"end":1191},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"epithelial","start":1175,"end":1185,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:52"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":15,"end":20},{"property_text":"small","neuron_type":"size","start":39,"end":44},{"property_text":"epithelial","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":70,"end":80,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:52"},{"property_text":"Large","neuron_type":"size","start":403,"end":408},{"property_text":"Small","neuron_type":"size","start":549,"end":554},{"property_text":"small","neuron_type":"size","start":775,"end":780},{"property_text":"trypsin-","neuron_type":"protein","start":834,"end":842,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:16424"},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":861,"end":866},{"property_text":"lower","neuron_type":"orientation","start":936,"end":941},{"property_text":"inner","neuron_type":"function","start":969,"end":974},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":1029,"end":1034},{"property_text":"small","neuron_type":"size","start":1039,"end":1044},{"property_text":"epithelial","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1175,"end":1185,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:52"}]},"fields":{"authors":["L B Margolis","A A Neyfakh"]}}

Brief exposure (30 s) of whole marrow to Merocyanine 540 resulted in a reduction in overall CFUS self-renewal in primary recipient spleens. Reduced self-renewal was also observed when fractionated CFUS subpopulations were used. Reduced self-renewal was not accompanied by obvious changes in primary spleen colony number or composition. Merocyanine 540 may interact with specific superficial membrane sites relevant to the self-replicative capacity process. Upon longer exposure, further Merocyanine 540 effects appear restricted to a reactive subpopulation of large (low self-replicative capacity) CFUS. Self-renewal was enhanced in this fractionated pool, without evidence of primary colony reduction, by intermediate staining. This strongly suggests that under certain conditions the dye can alter a fundamental functional property of susceptible stem cells, without their inactivation. Still more prolonged staining apparently leads to the selective elimination of this reactive low self-replicative capacity CFUS subset. A marked reduction in whole marrow-derived spleen colonies was accompanied by an enhanced self-renewal capacity among the survivors. These two Merocyanine 540 effects--stem cell modification, and stem cell elimination--may reflect different stages in an ongoing membrane photo-oxidation process.","authors":["D K Kerk","C P Myers","E F Hays"],"published_date":"1984-01-07","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"stem cells","start":1137,"end":1147,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":1142,"end":1147},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"stem","start":1137,"end":1141,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"}]},{"neuron_text":"--stem cell","start":1479,"end":1490,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":1486,"end":1490},{"neuron_type":"electrophysiology","property_text":"--","start":1479,"end":1481},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"stem","start":1481,"end":1485,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"}]},{"neuron_text":"stem cell","start":1509,"end":1518,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":1514,"end":1518},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"stem","start":1509,"end":1513,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"mouse","neuron_type":"species","start":199,"end":204,"onto_id":"ncbi:10090"},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":401,"end":408},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":579,"end":586},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":848,"end":853},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":965,"end":972},{"property_text":"functional","neuron_type":"function","start":1102,"end":1112},{"property_text":"stem","neuron_type":"morphology","start":1137,"end":1141,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"},{"property_text":"--","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1479,"end":1481},{"property_text":"stem","neuron_type":"morphology","start":1481,"end":1485,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"},{"property_text":"stem","neuron_type":"morphology","start":1509,"end":1513,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"},{"property_text":"--","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1530,"end":1532}]},"fields":{"authors":["D K Kerk","C P Myers","E F Hays"]}}

Ninety percent of the cells studied in the region of the border could be driven by electrical stimulation applied at the corresponding site in the opposite hemisphere. Within area 17, however, there were only about 30% of such cells. Through the combined use of electrical stimulation and reversible cortical cooling, two types of contributions by callosal fibres were revealed. One is that the callosal fibres constitute the only inputs from the ipsilateral eye to a cell. The other is that the callosal input provides ipsilateral reinforcement to a binocular cell. These results are compatible with neuroanatomical findings and show that binocularity of visual cortical cells in this animal depends, to a great degree, on the function of callosal fibres.","authors":["Y C Diao","Y K Wang","M L Pu"],"published_date":"1984-01-07","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"visual cortical cells","start":957,"end":978,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":973,"end":978},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"visual","start":957,"end":963},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"cortical","start":964,"end":972,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:688"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"visual cortex","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":77,"end":90,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:669"},{"property_text":"albino","neuron_type":"protein","start":98,"end":104,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:22173"},{"property_text":"rat","neuron_type":"species","start":105,"end":108,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"contralateral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":157,"end":170,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:28"},{"property_text":"cortical","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":601,"end":609,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:688"},{"property_text":"callosal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":649,"end":657,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:61"},{"property_text":"callosal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":696,"end":704,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:61"},{"property_text":"ipsilateral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":748,"end":759,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:26"},{"property_text":"callosal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":797,"end":805,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:61"},{"property_text":"input","neuron_type":"function","start":806,"end":811},{"property_text":"ipsilateral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":821,"end":832,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:26"},{"property_text":"visual","neuron_type":"function","start":957,"end":963},{"property_text":"cortical","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":964,"end":972,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:688"},{"property_text":"callosal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1041,"end":1049,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:61"}]},"fields":{"authors":["Y C Diao","Y K Wang","M L Pu"]}}

These thalamic reticular nucleus neurons (auditory thalamic reticular neurons; A-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons) showed a repetitive burst of grouped discharge upon electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus or of the auditory cortex. Many of them responded to tonal stimuli such as clicks or pips. Adjacent to the cluster of A-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons there were the cluster of thalamic reticular nucleus neurons receiving visual inputs (V-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons) and that receiving somatosensory inputs (S-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons). The cluster of A-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons was situated ventrally to the cluster of V-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons, both extending caudally from the level of the rostral tip of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The S-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons distributed rostrally to the clusters of A- and V-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons. Some of the sensory thalamic reticular nucleus neurons, usually found around the boundaries between the clusters of different sensory modalities, were activated from stimulation of different central sensory pathways. Single electric shocks directly applied to the cluster of A-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons suppressed discharges of relay neurons of the medial geniculate nucleus, either spontaneous or evoked by click stimuli or by electric shocks to the inferior colliculus. The postexcitatory suppression of medial geniculate nucleus relay neurons was similar in time course to the suppression following electrical stimulation of A-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons. Response latencies of the A-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons to inferior colliculus shocks were found to be 1.0-1.5 ms longer than those of the medial geniculate nucleus relay cells with respect to the modal and shortest values. It is suggested that A-thalamic reticular nucleus neurons are intercalated in the axon collateral circuit of the thalamocortical projection arising from relay neurons of the medial geniculate nucleus.","authors":["A Shosaku","I

The results have shown a strong labelling with 3H-GABA of the glial cells in all the layers of the olfactory bulb. A high concentration of grains was observed in the periglomerular region. The labelling in the external plexiform layer was uniformly distributed in the neuropile with the strongest activity at the level of the dendritic processes of the granule cells, leaving the mitral cell dendrites and cell bodies almost free of grains. 3H-DABA showed a very similar pattern to 3H-GABA. When olfactory bulb slices were preincubated with beta-alanine the labelling of the glial elements almost disappeared especially at the level of the olfactory nerve layer. The labelling pattern of the other layers of the bulb remained mostly unchanged. This supports the view that a population of periglomerular and granule cells are GABAergic and that beta-alanine competes with GABA uptake sites only in glial cells.","authors":["E H Jaffé","A C Cuello","J V Priestley"],"published_date":"1984-01-07","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"glial cells","start":304,"end":315,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":310,"end":315},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"glial","start":304,"end":309,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000060"}]},{"neuron_text":"granule cells","start":595,"end":608,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":603,"end":608},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"granule","start":595,"end":602,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000026"}]},{"neuron_text":"mitral cell","start":622,"end":633,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":629,"end":633},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"mitral","start":622,"end":628,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000030"}]},{"neuron_text":"periglomerular and granule cells","start":1030,"end":1062,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":1057,"end":1062},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"periglomerular","start":1030,"end":1044,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7281"},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"granule","start":1049,"end":1056,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000026"}]},{"neuron_text":"glial cells","start":1139,"end":1150,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":1145,"end":1150},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"glial","start":1139,"end":1144,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000060"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"GABAergic","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":53,"end":62,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000003"},{"property_text":"olfactory bulb","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":79,"end":93,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:507"},{"property_text":"GABA","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":168,"end":172,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000003"},{"property_text":"GABA","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":292,"end":296,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000003"},{"property_text":"glial","neuron_type":"morphology","start":304,"end":309,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000060"},{"property_text":"olfactory bulb","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":341,"end":355,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:507"},{"property_text":"periglomerular","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":408,"end":422,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7281"},{"property_text":"granule","neuron_type":"morphology","start":595,"end":602,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000026"},{"property_text":"mitral","neuron_type":"morphology","start":622,"end":628,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000030"},{"property_text":"GABA","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":727,"end":731,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000003"},{"property_text":"olfactory bulb","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":738,"end":752,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:507"},{"property_text":"glial","neuron_type":"morphology","start":817,"end":822,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000060"},{"property_text":"olfactory nerve layer","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":882,"end":903,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:5068"},{"property_text":"periglomerular","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1030,"end":1044,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7281"},{"property_text":"granule","neuron_type":"morphology","start":1049,"end":1056,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000026"},{"property_text":"GABAergic","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1067,"end":1076,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000003"},{"property_text":"GABA","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1113,"end":1117,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000003"},{"property_text":"glial","neuron_type":"morphology","start":1139,"end":1144,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000060"}]},"fields":{"authors":["E H Jaffé","A C Cuello","J V Priestley"]}}

These reaction time-correlated changes of firing disappeared or were markedly decreased when the movement was not triggered. Most of the task-related neurons also displayed late changes of firing during the force change, time-locked with the movement. Furthermore, a clear relation was observed between the rubral firing before and after the go-signal and the sensorimotor field of the recorded neuron: the neurons preferentially related to limb or trunk movements discharged with the highest frequency throughout the conditioned sequence and exhibited the best reaction time-correlated increases of firing during the movement initiation. In contrast, rubral neurons apparently related to head-movements generally discharged with low frequency and commonly exhibited decreases of firing in the initiation period.

One reason for the above findings may be that the transport of carcinoembryonic antigen in the subcutaneous tumors to the systemic blood flow is hindered.","authors":["T Motoyama","H Watanabe"],"published_date":"1984-01-26","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"positive cells","start":494,"end":508,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":503,"end":508},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"positive","start":494,"end":502}]},{"neuron_text":"positive cells","start":839,"end":853,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":848,"end":853},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"positive","start":839,"end":847}]},{"neuron_text":"positive cells","start":1433,"end":1447,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":1442,"end":1447},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"positive","start":1433,"end":1441}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":66,"end":71,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":72,"end":79,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"differentiated","neuron_type":"function","start":253,"end":267},{"property_text":"late","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":370,"end":374},{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":494,"end":502},{"property_text":"differentiated","neuron_type":"function","start":638,"end":652},{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":839,"end":847},{"property_text":"mice","neuron_type":"species","start":957,"end":961,"onto_id":"ncbi:10095"},{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1041,"end":1048,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"mice","neuron_type":"species","start":1243,"end":1247,"onto_id":"ncbi:10095"},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":1256,"end":1261,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1262,"end":1269,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":1433,"end":1441}]},"fields":{"authors":["T Motoyama","H Watanabe"]}}

Virtually all of the cells with high catalase activity (greater than 200 U/mg) remained viable upon exposure at 37 degrees C to 100-lb/in2 O2 on agar surfaces for 1 h, whereas low-catalase cells (less than 10 U/mg) lost 1.2 log units of viable cells during that treatment. Upon exposure to 500 microM H2O2, high-catalase cells lost 0.4 log units of the initial viable colonies during the same period in which low-catalase cells lost 3 log units of viable cells. The superoxide dismutase activity was the same in each test culture. These data support the role of intracellular catalase in protecting B. distasonis from oxidative damage resulting from hyperbaric oxygenation or H2O2 exposure. Catalase activity elicited by adding hemin to cells grown previously in medium lacking hemin was inhibited only 40% by prior incubation of the cells with chloramphenicol (30 micrograms/ml) and only 22% with rifampin (5 micrograms/ml). A model which is consistent with these data involves the production of an apocatalase in cells grown in low-hemin medium.

Two types of units were found, namely primary afferents supplying jaw raising muscle spindles and periodontal or gingival mechanoreceptors. These two groups of neurons exhibited a rostrocaudal somatotopy: the former occupied the entire rostral portion of the nucleus (A7-P2.3; trochlear decussation being taken as an arbitrary 0 level), the latter was located caudally (P3-P4.5) while the somata of both types of afferent fibres were present between P2.2 and P3. No evidence was found for representation of both tendon organs of jaw muscles and joint receptors. Among the units innervating muscle spindles, secondary afferents were largely more numerous than the primary ones. Among periodontal and gingival mechanoreceptor afferents, incisors were the most widely represented, followed by interalveolar gingiva and molars; the axonal conduction velocity ranged between 9 and 40 m/sec and between 8 and 16 m/sec for ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting neurons, respectively. The motor responses obtained by electrical stimulation of discrete areas of the MTN confirmed the presence of a high degree of segregation between the two different populations of neurons. In fact, jaw raising movements are obtained when stimulating the area within A7 and P2 containing the somata of spindle afferent neurons, while only jaw opening movements are elicited by stimulation of the caudal levels of the nucleus. These data also show that the periodontal neurons whose somata are located in the MTN participate in the jaw opening reflex, just as the more numerous periodontal mechanoreceptors whose somata are located in the Gasser ganglion. Soma-somatic and soma-axon hillock gap junctions were found among the neurons of the MTN, particularly in the caudal third of the nucleus.","authors":["M Passatore","M L Lucchi","G M Filippi","E Manni","R Bortolami"],"published_date":"1983-10-08","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"neurons","start":364,"end":371,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":364,"end":371}]},{"neuron_text":"neurons","start":1165,"end":1172,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1165,"end":1172}]},{"neuron_text":"neurons","start":1368,"end":1375,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1368,"end":1375}]},{"neuron_text":"afferent neurons","start":1497,"end":1513,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1506,"end":1513},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"afferent","start":1497,"end":1505}]},{"neuron_text":"neurons","start":1655,"end":1662,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1655,"end":1662}]},{"neuron_text":"neurons","start":1912,"end":1919,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1912,"end":1919}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":4,"end":36,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:460"},{"property_text":"rabbits","neuron_type":"species","start":80,"end":87,"onto_id":"ncbi:9986"},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":242,"end":249},{"property_text":"rostral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":440,"end":447,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:47"},{"property_text":"P2","neuron_type":"developmental","start":475,"end":477,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:000022"},{"property_text":"P3","neuron_type":"developmental","start":574,"end":576,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:000023"},{"property_text":"P4","neuron_type":"developmental","start":577,"end":579,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:000024"},{"property_text":"afferent","neuron_type":"function","start":617,"end":625},{"property_text":"P2","neuron_type":"developmental","start":654,"end":656,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:000022"},{"property_text":"P3","neuron_type":"developmental","start":663,"end":665,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:000023"},{"property_text":"secondary","neuron_type":"function","start":811,"end":820},{"property_text":"large","neuron_type":"size","start":836,"end":841},{"property_text":"primary","neuron_type":"function","start":867,"end":874},{"property_text":"motor","neuron_type":"function","start":1192,"end":1197},{"property_text":"P2","neuron_type":"developmental","start":1461,"end":1463,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:000022"},{"property_text":"afferent","neuron_type":"function","start":1497,"end":1505},{"property_text":"caudal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1583,"end":1589,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:29"},{"property_text":"ganglion","neuron_type":"morphology","start":1832,"end":1840,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000058"},{"property_text":"somatic","neuron_type":"function","start":1847,"end":1854},{"property_text":"caudal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1952,"end":1958,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:29"}]},"fields":{"authors":["M Passatore","M L Lucchi","G M Filippi","E Manni","R Bortolami"]}}

However, the steroid-binding properties of the oestrogen nuclear receptor of human cells under different conditions of temperature and ionic strength have received little attention despite the relevance of the receptor for interpretation of assay data. This paper reports a study on the influence of temperature and ionic strength on the exchange rate of [3H]oestradiol from human breast and endometrial nuclear receptor. When the oestrogen nuclear receptor complex was bound to intact or sheared nuclei, the displacement of bound [3H]oestradiol into buffer containing excess unlabelled oestradiol increased with temperature but was significant over 24 h even at 4 degrees C for nuclei from both breast and endometrium. The use of protease inhibitors combined with relabelling of nuclear receptor after incubation confirmed that the observations at 4 degrees C represented exchange of hormone rather than degradation of the hormone-receptor complex. Degradation was seen at higher temperatures. Measurement of the on-rate of [3H]oestradiol onto nuclear receptor prefilled with unlabelled oestradiol showed that on-rate was also significant over 24 h at 4 degrees C. The displacement of oestradiol from salt-extracted, hydroxylapatite-precipitated receptor also increased with temperature although, in this case, no displacement could be detected until temperatures above 4 degrees C were reached. Only 40% of total oestrogen receptor detectable in intact human nuclei was solubilized by the standard method of salt extraction in 0.6 mol KCl/l. As the salt concentration was raised (0-0.6 mol KCl/l), an increase in the stripping of oestradiol from the hormone-receptor complex was observed. Such stripping of nuclear receptor during salt extraction would lead to a false impression of the proportion of 'empty' nuclear receptors. The results show that filled oestrogen nuclear receptor from human tumour tissue may be assayed by exchange at 4 degrees C over 24 h. This eliminates the protease degradation of receptor which occurs at higher assay temperatures.","authors":["C A Love","S K Cowan","L M Laing","R E Leake"],"published_date":"1984-01-26","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"cells of human","start":56,"end":70,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":56,"end":61},{"neuron_type":"species","property_text":"human","start":65,"end":70,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"}]},{"neuron_text":"human cells","start":221,"end":232,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":227,"end":232},{"neuron_type":"species","property_text":"human","start":221,"end":226,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":65,"end":70,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":209,"end":217},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":221,"end":226,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":354,"end":362},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":519,"end":524,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":556,"end":564},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":593,"end":601},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":932,"end":940},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1076,"end":1084},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1197,"end":1205},{"property_text":"salt-","neuron_type":"protein","start":1346,"end":1351,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:20689"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1391,"end":1399},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1569,"end":1577},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":1599,"end":1604,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"salt","neuron_type":"protein","start":1654,"end":1658,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:20689"},{"property_text":"salt","neuron_type":"protein","start":1695,"end":1699,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:20689"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1804,"end":1812},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1861,"end":1869},{"property_text":"salt","neuron_type":"protein","start":1877,"end":1881,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:20689"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":2021,"end":2029},{"property_text":"human","neuron_type":"species","start":2035,"end":2040,"onto_id":"ncbi:9606"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":2152,"end":2160}]},"fields":{"authors":["C A Love","S K Cowan","L M Laing","R E Leake"]}}

The clearance of 14C-misonidazole from the tumours and all normal tissues could be characterised by two distinct phases: a rapid phase (0.7 h half-life) followed by a much slower phase (approximately 50 h half-life). The distribution of retained 14C from labelled misonidazole within tumour-bearing mice was also measured by whole animal autoradiographic techniques. This procedure confirmed the biodistribution of 14C-misonidazole determined by liquid scintillation procedures.

Since the pattern of development of this controversial nucleus was similar to that of nuclei in both centromedial and basolateral groups, time of origin data could not aid its assignment to one of these subdivisions.","authors":["J McConnell","J B Angevine"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"Neurons","start":152,"end":159,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"Neurons","start":152,"end":159}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"mice","neuron_type":"species","start":60,"end":64,"onto_id":"ncbi:10095"},{"property_text":"neonatal","neuron_type":"developmental","start":130,"end":138,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:0000005"},{"property_text":"embryonic","neuron_type":"developmental","start":209,"end":218,"onto_id":"HBP_DEVELOPMENTAL:0000x"},{"property_text":"rostral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":363,"end":370,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:47"},{"property_text":"caudal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":374,"end":380,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:29"},{"property_text":"anterior","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":395,"end":403,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7299"},{"property_text":"posterior","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":407,"end":416,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7300"},{"property_text":"individual","neuron_type":"function","start":428,"end":438},{"property_text":"cortical","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":459,"end":467,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:688"},{"property_text":"basolateral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":595,"end":606,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:24"}]},"fields":{"authors":["J McConnell","J B Angevine"]}}

The results have been conflicting, possibly due to different methods of analysis. For example, some investigators have found i.v. administered morphine produces a greater percentage decrease in nociceptive transmission when the spinal cord is intact compared to the transected state. Therefore, they concluded that morphine elicits a supraspinal-mediated inhibition. Conversely, others have reported that the increase in noxious stimulus-evoked responses of dorsal horn neurons upon cold blocking the spinal cord was reduced by i.v. morphine. They therefore concluded that morphine decreases descending inhibition. We tested the effects of i.v. morphine on spinal cord multireceptive neurons in the presence and absence of descending inhibition. Using the above methods of analysis, our results were found to be consistent with their findings which indicate that the method of analysis used is critical to the interpretation reached. To determine how these calculations would be affected by a depressant effect on the spinal cord neurons only, we performed similar experiments iontophoresing gamma-aminobutyric acid onto these dorsal horn neurons. The similarity between the morphine and gamma-aminobutyric acid data suggests that the effects of systemically administered morphine on multireceptive dorsal horn neurons can be adequately explained by a spinal cord site of action.","authors":["P J Soja","J G Sinclair"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"dorsal horn neurons","start":722,"end":741,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":734,"end":741},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"dorsal horn","start":722,"end":733,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7226"}]},{"neuron_text":"neurons","start":948,"end":955,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":948,"end":955}]},{"neuron_text":"spinal cord neurons","start":1282,"end":1301,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1294,"end":1301},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"spinal cord","start":1282,"end":1293,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:4645"}]},{"neuron_text":"dorsal horn neurons","start":1391,"end":1410,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1403,"end":1410},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"dorsal horn","start":1391,"end":1402,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7226"}]},{"neuron_text":"dorsal horn neurons","start":1563,"end":1582,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":1575,"end":1582},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"dorsal horn","start":1563,"end":1574,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7226"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"spinal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":59,"end":65,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:1"},{"property_text":"nociceptive","neuron_type":"function","start":80,"end":91},{"property_text":"nociceptive","neuron_type":"function","start":169,"end":180},{"property_text":"spinal cord","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":214,"end":225,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:4645"},{"property_text":"nociceptive","neuron_type":"function","start":458,"end":469},{"property_text":"spinal cord","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":492,"end":503,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:4645"},{"property_text":"dorsal horn","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":722,"end":733,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7226"},{"property_text":"spinal cord","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":765,"end":776,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:4645"},{"property_text":"descending","neuron_type":"orientation","start":856,"end":866},{"property_text":"spinal cord","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":921,"end":932,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:4645"},{"property_text":"descending","neuron_type":"orientation","start":987,"end":997},{"property_text":"spinal cord","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1282,"end":1293,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:4645"},{"property_text":"dorsal horn","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1391,"end":1402,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7226"},{"property_text":"dorsal horn","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1563,"end":1574,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7226"},{"property_text":"spinal cord","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1616,"end":1627,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:4645"}]},"fields":{"authors":["P J Soja","J G Sinclair"]}}

Subsequently, systematic examination demonstrated that out of 102 MBH neurons 52 (51%) increased their firing by at least 30% with application of NaCl, using currents no greater than 10 nA. No such effect was obtained in response to Na application from a dilute solution (0.05 or 0.1 M). When glutamate was absent from the electrodes, the incidence of Na+ sensitivity fell to 17%, despite the routine use of backing currents to the glutamate barrel. K+ ions were more active than Na+ ions in producing excitation. When Na+ sensitivity was found, however, Na+ effects were produced by currents greater than K+ currents producing equivalent excitation. Like glutamate, K+ ions were capable of greatly enhancing responses to Na+. Comparison was made between cortisol and Na+ sensitivity in 70 MBH neurons; 28 cells responded to both, and 24 of them were inhibited by cortisol. Thus Na+ sensitivity is a frequent characteristic of MBH neurons inhibited by cortisol, and was present in 83% of cortisol-sensitive cells in this region. Iontophoresis of Na+ is commonly used as a control in pharmacological studies of the nervous system. Even more common is the case of concentrated NaCl solutions for recording.

In chronically implanted rats, an in vivo oxidation current that peaks at +0.1 V has been detected inside the locus coeruleus complex. This current whose potential is characteristic of the oxidation of the catechols, had the same anatomical localization as the noradrenergic cells. Pharmacological experiments have been made to ascertain which catechols contribute to this in vivo current. Monoamine oxidase inhibition by pargyline was followed by a total and rapid suppression of the in vivo signal. Blockade of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase by FLA-63 induced a significant increase in the electrochemical signal. Post-mortem analysis of locus coeruleus catechol levels after administration of this drug revealed a considerable decrease in NA and its major catechol metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol although DA and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were significantly increased. Comparison of these results led us to conclude that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is probably the most important contributor to the in vivo oxidation current. This assertion is corroborated by results obtained after tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine: the in vivo catechol current was rapidly suppressed and post-mortem levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were significantly reduced while 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol remained almost normal. An attempt was made to selectively destroy the locus coeruleus cell bodies by a unilateral injection of ibotenic acid (10 micrograms). Eight to 15 days after injection, no current was detectable in the injected side although it was still present in the contralateral intact side. Post-mortem levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol levels of the lesioned side were 29% and 17%, respectively, of those in the intact side. Thus, we assumed that the in vivo catechol current in the locus coeruleus comes from the oxidation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid most probably synthesized by the noradrenergic cell bodies.","authors":["M Buda","G De Simoni","F Gonon","J F Pujol"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"noradrenergic neurons","start":196,"end":217,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":210,"end":217},{"neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","property_text":"noradrenergic","start":196,"end":209,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000016"}]},{"neuron_text":"noradrenergic cells","start":480,"end":499,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":494,"end":499},{"neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","property_text":"noradrenergic","start":480,"end":493,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000016"}]},{"neuron_text":"locus coeruleus cell","start":1630,"end":1650,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":1646,"end":1650},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"locus coeruleus","start":1630,"end":1645,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:147"}]},{"neuron_text":"noradrenergic cell","start":2201,"end":2219,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":2215,"end":2219},{"neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","property_text":"noradrenergic","start":2201,"end":2214,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000016"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"catecholamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":112,"end":125,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000018"},{"property_text":"locus coeruleus","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":144,"end":159,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:147"},{"property_text":"brain","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":163,"end":168,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:5004"},{"property_text":"noradrenergic","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":196,"end":209,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000016"},{"property_text":"rats","neuron_type":"species","start":244,"end":248,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"locus coeruleus","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":329,"end":344,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:147"},{"property_text":"characteristic","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":386,"end":400,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:89"},{"property_text":"noradrenergic","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":480,"end":493,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000016"},{"property_text":"Monoamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":609,"end":618,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000021"},{"property_text":"rapid","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":679,"end":684},{"property_text":"dopamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":732,"end":740,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"locus coeruleus","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":854,"end":869,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:147"},{"property_text":"DA","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1029,"end":1031,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"tyrosine hydroxylase","neuron_type":"protein","start":1329,"end":1349,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:21823"},{"property_text":"rapidly","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1424,"end":1431},{"property_text":"locus coeruleus","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1630,"end":1645,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:147"},{"property_text":"contralateral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1836,"end":1849,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:28"},{"property_text":"locus coeruleus","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":2093,"end":2108,"onto_id":"ABA_REGION:147"},{"property_text":"noradrenergic","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":2201,"end":2214,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000016"}]},"fields":{"authors":["M Buda","G De Simoni","F Gonon","J F Pujol"]}}

In order to determine whether anatomical reorganization of the corticospinal or brainstem-spinal pathways also occurred which might account for the sparing of the tactile placing response, we used retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase to map supraspinal neurons which project caudal to a spinal hemisection made either neonatally or in adulthood. The pattern of HRP labeling in the brainstem was identical in both the neonatal and adult operates. Neonatal operates, however, showed severe retrograde cell loss in brainstem nuclei which projected to the damaged side of the cord. This massive retrograde cell loss was not seen when lesions were made in the adult. In contrast, sparing of corticospinal projections and anatomical reorganization of the corticospinal tract were found after neonatal, but not adult spinal cord lesions. In adult operates, this lesion abolished HRP labeling in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, while in all of the neonatal operates, HRP labeled cells were found throughout these cortical areas. The labeled cells had many characteristics in common with those of the normal CST. They were located in lamina V of cytoarchitectonic areas 4, 3, 1-2, and 5. Although the range of cell diameter was normal, the mean diameter of these spared neurons was below normal. Although the 'spared' CST may share many characteristics with the normal CST, its axons must have reached caudal segments of the cord by an abnormal pathway, since the normal route for the CST was destroyed by the lesion. The results indicate that two different regions of the CNS responded differently to the same neonatal lesion. Growing CST axons exhibited anatomical plasticity, contrasting with the retrograde death of the brainstem spinal tracts. We suggest that this difference between the two classes of pathways is due to the difference in time of their development. Only the latest developing pathways displayed anatomical sparing. The difference may also be seen in terms of the behavioral results. Only late-developing motor patterns were spared after neonatal lesions.","authors":["B S Bregman","M E

Nevertheless, nitrosocimetidine has been found to be a weak carcinogen or a noncarcinogen and to be very poor at modifying DNA in vivo when administered p.o. We have found that nitrosocimetidine, like methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, decomposes very rapidly when incubated with thiol compound in neutral pH buffer. Much of this decomposition is denitrosation. In the presence of excess reduced glutathione, about 35% of the degradation results in denitrosation to produce cimetidine, and in the presence of excess cysteine about 65% results in denitrosation to produce cimetidine. The compound also rapidly decomposes in whole blood isolated from rats; about 70% of this decomposition produces cimetidine. In solution with purified rat hemoglobin, approximately 90% of the nitrosocimetidine degradation proceeds via a denitrosation pathway; hemoglobin cysteine residues have been implicated in the denitrosation reaction. In parallel experiments with methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, it has been found that, although a fraction of the decomposition of this agent in the presence of thiol compound, in isolated whole blood, and in solution with purified hemoglobin generates the denitrosated derivative, denitrosation is in the range of one-third to one-half of that found for nitrosocimetidine. Denitrosation and degradation to form a methylating species appear to be the major nitrosocimetidine and methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine decomposition pathways in vitro. There is no indication that methylnitrosourea degradation is sensitive to thiols, nor is the compound susceptible to denitrosation at neutral pH. Molar-equivalent doses of methyl group-radiolabeled nitrosocimetidine, methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and methylnitrosourea were administered via the tail vein to groups of F344 rats, and the DNA methylation yields in lung, liver, kidney, and brain tissue were assessed. Of the organs considered, DNA methylation was greatest in the lungs of methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-treated animals, followed by kidney (25% of the lung value). Methylation of lung tissue DNA in methylnitrosourea-treated animals was about 50% of that observed in the methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine experiments; DNA methylation in the other organs was about equivalent to that found in the lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","authors":["D E Jensen"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"cultured cells","start":475,"end":489,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":484,"end":489},{"neuron_type":"function","property_text":"cultured","start":475,"end":483}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"positive","neuron_type":"function","start":341,"end":349},{"property_text":"cultured","neuron_type":"function","start":475,"end":483},{"property_text":"rapidly","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":834,"end":841},{"property_text":"rapidly","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1183,"end":1190},{"property_text":"rats","neuron_type":"species","start":1231,"end":1235,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"rat","neuron_type":"species","start":1316,"end":1319,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"rats","neuron_type":"species","start":2384,"end":2388,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"brain","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":2449,"end":2454,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:5004"}]},"fields":{"authors":["D E Jensen"]}}

A culture system which supports the normal development of 10.4 day organogenesis-phase rat conceptuses was utilized. In this system, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a potent Stage I and II promoter, disrupted the morphology and function of the embryonic visceral yolk sac (dose required to affect 50% of conceptuses, 18 nM). The effect was characterized by an abnormal, progressive separation of the two cellular layers of the yolk sac, but cellular differentiation appeared to be uninterrupted. Parallel log dose-response lines for this effect were produced by phorbol-12,13-dibenzoate (dose required to affect 50% of conceptuses, 200 nM) and phorbol-12,13-diacetate (dose required to affect 50% of conceptuses, 300 nM) which are consistent with structure-activity relationships for other promotional actions of these compounds. In addition, the weak Stage I promoter, 4-O-methyl-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, produced identical effects but was 1400 times less potent than was tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, while mezerein, a potent Stage II promoter, was as potent as was tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. These observations support the hypothesis that embryonic cells may be differentially sensitive to early- and late-stage promoters. Ethylphenylpropiolate, a nonpromoting hyperplastic agent in mouse skin, had no effect on yolk sac morphology or function at its maximum solubility (1.85 mM). Yolk sac disruption by tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was potentiated by heat inactivation (56 degrees, 30 min) or 0.45-micron filtration of the culture medium. A more advanced stage of yolk sac development was less sensitive to tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate disruption since 11.4 day conceptuses, which were cultured for 30 hr, developed identical lesions, but tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was at least 5-fold less potent. Thus, the tumor promoter-induced lesions of the rat yolk sac have some features consistent with late-stage tumor promotion and do not appear to be associated with general toxicity, hyperplasia, or alterations in cellular differentiation.

Ultrastructural studies of the terminals, involving the K-pyroantimonate method for the demonstration of calcium and control tests with EGTA, show that calcium occurs in mitochondria and in various types of vesicular structure. Quantitative investigations indicate that mitochondria accumulate calcium during a short period of high neurohormone-release activity (\"active state\"; ca. 45 min) and release it again into the axoplasm some hours later, during a period of low secretory activity (\"resting state\"). Probably, in this way mitochondria play an important role in the buffering of the axoplasmic calcium concentration during high hormone-release activity. HRP-incorporation studies strongly suggest that the calcium-containing vesicular structures constitute a mechanism of membrane sequestration by which the caudo-dorsal cells axon terminals resorb, transform, and release parts of the axolemma after exocytotic hormone release. The results furthermore indicate that this mechanism also may be involved in the control of the calcium concentration of the axoplasm, by taking up calcium from the axoplasm and releasing it into the extracellular space.","authors":["P Buma","E W Roubos"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"dorsal cells","start":47,"end":59,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":54,"end":59},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"dorsal","start":47,"end":53,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7262"}]},{"neuron_text":"dorsal cells","start":1007,"end":1019,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":1014,"end":1019},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"dorsal","start":1007,"end":1013,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7262"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"neuroendocrine","neuron_type":"function","start":26,"end":40},{"property_text":"dorsal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":47,"end":53,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7262"},{"property_text":"dorsal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1007,"end":1013,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7262"}]},"fields":{"authors":["P Buma","E W Roubos"]}}

A population of nerve cells and their pinealofugal (afferent) fiber systems were stained by means of the acetylcholinesterase method, while catecholamine-containing pinealopetal (efferent) fibers were demonstrated with the use of the glyoxylic acid method. Afferent axons were mainly found in the postero-proximal portion of the organ, and the patterns of their distribution were classified into three groups according to the characteristic densities of the reaction product. The number of acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons in the avian pineal organs examined in this study varied extremely from species to species, ranging from 0 to 362. Catecholamine-containing nerve fibers penetrating the antero-lateral walls of the pineal follicles accompanied blood vessels and were arranged more densely in the distal portion of the organ, in contrast to the distribution of the acetylcholinesterase-positive nerve fibers. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the distributional patterns of both types of neural projections was performed for the pineal organ of every avian species examined. In avian species possessing a relatively conspicuous afferent projection, such as Passeriformes, Nycticorax, and Milvus, terminals of catecholamine-containing nerve fibers were observed exclusively in the interfollicular and perivascular tissues. In Galliformes, which display only few pineal afferents, catecholamine-containing fibers terminate not only in the interfollicular space, but also in the neuroepithelial parenchyma. The regional differences in the innervation in the avian pineal organ suggest that the pinealocytes ranging from more sensory-like to more secretory-like elements are arranged in a mosaic-like pattern.","authors":["T Sato","K Wake"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"acetylcholinesterase-positive neurons","start":613,"end":650,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":643,"end":650},{"neuron_type":"protein","property_text":"acetylcholinesterase-positive","start":613,"end":642,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:11423"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"particular","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":74,"end":84,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7266"},{"property_text":"afferent","neuron_type":"function","start":175,"end":183},{"property_text":"acetylcholinesterase","neuron_type":"protein","start":228,"end":248,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:11423"},{"property_text":"catecholamine-containing","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":263,"end":287,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000018"},{"property_text":"efferent","neuron_type":"function","start":302,"end":310},{"property_text":"Afferent","neuron_type":"function","start":380,"end":388},{"property_text":"characteristic","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":549,"end":563,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:89"},{"property_text":"acetylcholinesterase-positive","neuron_type":"protein","start":613,"end":642,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:11423"},{"property_text":"Catecholamine-containing","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":766,"end":790,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000018"},{"property_text":"lateral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":827,"end":834,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:15"},{"property_text":"acetylcholinesterase-positive","neuron_type":"protein","start":997,"end":1026,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:11423"},{"property_text":"neural","neuron_type":"function","start":1122,"end":1128},{"property_text":"afferent","neuron_type":"function","start":1262,"end":1270},{"property_text":"projection","neuron_type":"function","start":1271,"end":1281},{"property_text":"catecholamine-containing","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1343,"end":1367,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000018"},{"property_text":"catecholamine-containing","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1513,"end":1537,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000018"},{"property_text":"neuroepithelial","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1610,"end":1625,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:7298"},{"property_text":"sensory","neuron_type":"function","start":1756,"end":1763}]},"fields":{"authors":["T Sato","K Wake"]}}

Recent electrophysiological data, showing that estrogens significantly attenuate the ability of apomorphine to inhibit the firing activity of type B dopamine neurons in the rat substantia nigra, suggest that these hormones may also induce subsensitivity of dopamine autoreceptors. In accord with this hypothesis, estrogen-treated rats showed no marked decrease of motility counts when challenged with apomorphine (20-50 micrograms/kg) from 24 to 72 h after the last hormone administration. Similarly, the decrease of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels induced by apomorphine (20 micrograms/kg) in the caudate nucleus, in oil-treated control rats was almost completely counteracted by estrogen treatment. Dopamine agonists, such as 2-alpha-bromocriptine, piribedil, 3 hydroxyphenylpropylpiperidine and n-propylnorapomorphine, failed to induce hypomotility when administered to estrogen-treated rats. These behavioural and biochemical results, along with the electrophysiological data, indicate that estrogen treatment is able to induce hyposensitivity of dopamine autoreceptors. These results may be relevant to the clinical findings indicating that the activity of dopamine receptor agonists varies in relation to sex or hormonal treatments.","authors":["P Piccardi","F Bernardi","Z Rossetti","G Corsini"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"dopamine neurons in the rat substantia nigra","start":334,"end":378,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"neurons","start":343,"end":350},{"neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","property_text":"dopamine","start":334,"end":342,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"neuron_type":"species","property_text":"rat","start":358,"end":361,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"substantia nigra","start":362,"end":378,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:1836"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"synaptic","neuron_type":"function","start":121,"end":129},{"property_text":"dopamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":130,"end":138,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":139,"end":147},{"property_text":"firing","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":308,"end":314},{"property_text":"dopamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":334,"end":342,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"rat","neuron_type":"species","start":358,"end":361,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"substantia nigra","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":362,"end":378,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:1836"},{"property_text":"dopamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":442,"end":450,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"rats","neuron_type":"species","start":515,"end":519,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"caudate nucleus","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":785,"end":800,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:185"},{"property_text":"rats","neuron_type":"species","start":825,"end":829,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"Dopamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":888,"end":896,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"rats","neuron_type":"species","start":1077,"end":1081,"onto_id":"ncbi:10116"},{"property_text":"dopamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1238,"end":1246,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"dopamine","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1349,"end":1357,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000007"},{"property_text":"receptor","neuron_type":"function","start":1358,"end":1366}]},"fields":{"authors":["P Piccardi","F Bernardi","Z Rossetti","G Corsini"]}}

In this report, we have examined bone marrow and spleen cells for their recovery patterns of CFUS, CFUGM, CFUE, BFUE and 59Fe-incorporation, along with the usual peripheral blood indices (packed red cell volume, WBC and differential) from mice administered Lithium after receiving 200 rad whole body irradiation. Lithium increased granulopoietic recovery as measured by significant elevations in both marrow and spleen derived CFUGM compared to those values obtained from radiation controls. Significant elevation in the WBC, consisting mainly of neutrophils, was also observed. Bone marrow and splenic derived erythroid stem cells (CFUE, BFUE) and % 59Fe-incorporation measured from peripheral blood, femur and spleen were all slightly reduced, but not to a significant degree to alter the packed red cell volume. The CFUS populations from both irradiated groups (control and Lithium-treated) were depressed when compared to normal non-irr controls and this degree of suppression was greater in the Lithium-treated group. These results document the ability of Lithium to stimulate the recovery of granulopoiesis after radiation-induced hematopoietic injury and suggest Lithium may be useful in ameliorating the neutropenia that can often develop after routine radiotherapy protocols.","authors":["V S Gallicchio","M G Chen","T D Watts","C Gamba-Vitalo"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"stem cell","start":138,"end":147,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":143,"end":147},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"stem","start":138,"end":142,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"}]},{"neuron_text":"stem cells","start":960,"end":970,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cells","start":965,"end":970},{"neuron_type":"morphology","property_text":"stem","start":960,"end":964,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"stem","neuron_type":"morphology","start":138,"end":142,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"},{"property_text":"peripheral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":501,"end":511,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:6"},{"property_text":"mice","neuron_type":"species","start":578,"end":582,"onto_id":"ncbi:10095"},{"property_text":"stem","neuron_type":"morphology","start":960,"end":964,"onto_id":"HBP_MORPHOLOGY:0000052"},{"property_text":"peripheral","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1023,"end":1033,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:6"}]},"fields":{"authors":["V S Gallicchio","M G Chen","T D Watts","C Gamba-Vitalo"]}}

Peroxisomes, Type II cell constituents, were clustered around and continuous with endoplasmic reticulum. The shape of the peroxisomes became indistinct after Type I cell injury by butylated hydroxytoluene. Also the density of the matrix was reduced in proportion to the reduction in the peroxidatic activity of catalase. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the number of peroxisomes. New pinocytotic vesicles, one of the Type I cell characteristics, were generated at the apical and basal cell surfaces.

Gastric acid secretion and gastrinemia were measured during 90 min. After intragastric calcium injection, the acid secretion was increased during 60 min in almost all subjects (87 to 100 p. 100 of subjects in the various groups) whereas gastrin release was increased in the majority (57 to 84 p. 100) of cases. The possible dissociation between the acid and gastrinic responses implies that the calcium-induced acid response is independent of the calcium-induced gastrin release. During control experiments in normal individuals, continuous intragastric perfusion (300 ml/h) of NaCl 0.15 M failed to alter gastric acid secretion or gastrin release, whereas continuous intragastric perfusion of CaCl2 0,118 M enhanced gastric acid secretion and gastrin release. The action of CaCl2 0,118 M is therefore not attributable to gastric distension but directly to calcium itself. The stimulation of acid secretion by intragastric calcium was more conspicuous in patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer than in normal subjects. The release of gastrin was higher in gastritis and duodenal ulcer than in the normal group. It is hypothesized that intragastric calcium increases the cholinergic tone of the parietal cell.","authors":["A Brassinne","S Wandja"],"published_date":"1983-11-23","neuron":[{"neuron_text":"parietal cell","start":1560,"end":1573,"neuron_properties":[{"neuron_type":"neurontrigger","property_text":"cell","start":1569,"end":1573},{"neuron_type":"brainregion","property_text":"parietal","start":1560,"end":1568,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:32"}]}],"all_neuron_properties":[{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":163,"end":170,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"Gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":365,"end":372,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"gastrin","neuron_type":"protein","start":602,"end":609,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14459"},{"property_text":"gastrin","neuron_type":"protein","start":828,"end":835,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14459"},{"property_text":"continuous","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":895,"end":905},{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":971,"end":978,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"gastrin","neuron_type":"protein","start":997,"end":1004,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14459"},{"property_text":"continuous","neuron_type":"electrophysiology","start":1022,"end":1032},{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1082,"end":1089,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"gastrin","neuron_type":"protein","start":1109,"end":1116,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14459"},{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1187,"end":1194,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"gastric","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1334,"end":1341,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:65"},{"property_text":"gastrin","neuron_type":"protein","start":1400,"end":1407,"onto_id":"NCBI_GENE:14459"},{"property_text":"cholinergic","neuron_type":"neurotransmitter","start":1536,"end":1547,"onto_id":"HBP_NEUROTRANSMITTER:0000005"},{"property_text":"parietal","neuron_type":"brainregion","start":1560,"end":1568,"onto_id":"UNKN_REGION:32"}]},"fields":{"authors":["A Brassinne","S Wandja"]}}
